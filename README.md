# Radius NFT Protocol

Radius is an algorithmically-governed NFT forge which works to convert fungible value into non-fungible tokens. Radius works by incentivising users to burn the equity products produced by staking Radius - Radius Gas and Radius Catalyst - in order to potentially mint one or more NFTs. The system limits the production of NFTs to a network-determined rate by adjusting the difficulty of successfully forging any NFT based on forging demand in the same way that Bitcoin governs the rate of production of new blocks on the network. 

Unlike Bitcoin however, Radius features multiple types of minted NFTs:

Relics pay the holder an equity share of a percentage of all forge operations on the network
Powerups provide staking and forging bonuses to their holder
Gems are globally unique and the primary assignees of the burned value of all Gas and Catalyst on the Radius network. Furthermore, Gems can be assigned further value by their holders through an engraving process, which are permanent and performable once during the ownership period of that user. Subsequent owners may add engravings, which allows Gems to be used as aggregators of value.

Radius targets the forging of 64 NFTs every 15 minutes. This target forging rate decays every 90 days to half its previous value until reduced to one. (DO WE CAP THE TOTAL FORGEABLE SUPPLY OF GEMS?)
